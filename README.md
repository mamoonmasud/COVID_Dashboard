This is a visualization project, that was done to explore how we can display geodata using Folium in Python. You might not be able to view the maps if you are checking it out in GitHub since GitHub doesn't support Folium, the library used in this project for visualizing maps in Python. Either download the notebook and run it on your local machine or you can  copy the link and render it at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
